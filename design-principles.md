# Collect design principles the site is following

## General

- Pages should be reasonable size. Avoid mono-pages.
- Zero state should always be reachable. For instance, clicking a radio button that's selected should clear it. This makes the page more debuggability and builds user trust that they're not going to take any destructive action.
- Text expected to be spoken uses monospace.
- Strongly prefer lucide icons. Don't use emoji as icons.

## Explaining deep canvassing

- Don't say "deep canvassing" to first time learners.
