Voter: Hi there! I understand you want to talk about healthcare policy. I'm honestly pretty skeptical about government expansion in healthcare. What's your take on this?

Canvasser: I appreciate you sharing that perspective. Can you tell me a bit about what makes you feel skeptical about it?

Voter: Well, I just worry about costs and efficiency. Government programs tend to be expensive and bureaucratic. I've had bad experiences with government services before.

Canvasser: That sounds really frustrating. Can you share more about those experiences you mentioned?

Voter: Yeah, when my mom needed Medicare help, it took months of paperwork and phone calls. It was such a hassle when she was already sick.

Canvasser: I'm so sorry you and your mom went through that. That must have been incredibly stressful during an already difficult time.

Voter: Thanks for saying that. It really was tough. I guess I just don't trust that expanding healthcare will make things better.

Canvasser: I understand that concern completely. What if there were ways to expand access while also improving the experience you had?

Voter: Hmm, I suppose if they could actually streamline things and make it less bureaucratic... but I'm still not sure it would work.

Canvasser: That makes total sense. Would you be open to hearing about some specific aspects of this proposal that might address those concerns?
