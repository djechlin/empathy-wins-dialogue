            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-8">For this module, we'll focus on a hypothetical city ballot initiative to improve bus and subway service. The campaign is deploying deep canvassers to talk to people who are registered to vote, but who never vote in off-year local elections.

Do you think the canvasser and possible voters will get into arguments? Maybe there won't be heated partisan debates, but the the canvasser and voter genuinely disagree about the importance of voting. The canvasser must truly persuade the prospective voter to change their minds. Therefore, we can study the full deep canvass method just by learning how to persuade nonvoters in a local election.</p>
