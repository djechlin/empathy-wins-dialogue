# Improved Canvassing Dialogue - Version 2

**Voter:** Hello? Is someone at my door?

**Canvasser:** Hi. My name is Lucas, and I'm interested in talking with you more about health care in America.

**Voter:** Oh, healthcare? I don't know if I have much to say about that.

**Voter:** I'm Frank, by the way.

**Voter:** What organization are you with?

**Canvasser:** I'm with Americans with Diabetes. And we're interested in capping the price of insulin so that citizens pay less money for lifesaving medication. Which costs big companies only a dollar to make, but sells for two hundred dollars.

**Voter:** Oh, I see. Well, I don't have diabetes myself, so I haven't really thought much about insulin prices. Sounds like there's quite a markup there, but isn't that how most medications work? Companies spend money on research and then charge more to make their profit back. I tend to think the government getting involved just makes things more expensive in the long run with all the bureaucracy.

**Canvasser:** Yeah, I understand where you're coming from. Definitely government regulation can cause prices to go up, certainly for new medication research. But insulin's been around for a hundred years. Actually, the inventor of insulin sold the patent for one dollar so that everyone could have access to this medication. And what has happened is these companies have taken this very, very cheap to make product that sells for a dollar in Mexico and are charging people two hundred, three hundred dollars here.

**Voter:** Hmm, I didn't know that about insulin being that old or that the inventor sold it for so little. That does make it seem different than new medications still under research. So it's that much cheaper in Mexico? That's pretty wild. I guess I can see why people would be upset about that. But I'm still not sure what the government could do that wouldn't just create more problems. You know how these things go.

**Canvasser:** I do know how these things go. And certainly, when the government gets involved, it can cause problems. But Frank, can I ask - do you know anyone personally who's been affected by high medication costs?

**Voter:** Well, actually... my nephew had to go without his insulin when he was between jobs last year. My sister was beside herself with worry. It was only for about a month, but she's a single mom and couldn't afford to help him pay for it on top of her other bills.

**Canvasser:** Oh wow, Frank. That must have been incredibly scary for your whole family. Can you tell me more about what that month was like? How did it affect your nephew day to day?

**Voter:** It was terrifying, honestly. He was trying to ration what little insulin he had left, which I learned later is really dangerous. My sister was calling me crying because she felt so helpless. He was getting sicker, and we were all just praying he'd find work with insurance before something serious happened.

**Canvasser:** That sounds absolutely heartbreaking. And the fact that your sister felt helpless as a mom - I can't imagine how painful that must have been for her. Did your nephew end up finding work in time?

**Voter:** Thank God, yes. He got hired at a place with decent insurance just before things got really bad. But those weeks of watching him get weaker, and seeing my sister blame herself... it really opened my eyes to how broken this system is.

**Canvasser:** I'm so glad he found work when he did. You know, Frank, your nephew's story really hits home for me because my brother has diabetes too. Right now he's okay because of his current job, but he lives with this constant worry that if he gets laid off or changes jobs, he could end up in the exact same situation your nephew was in.

**Voter:** That's got to be so stressful for him - and for you watching him worry about it.

**Canvasser:** It really is. And what breaks my heart is that this fear - the fear your sister felt, the fear my brother lives with - it's completely unnecessary. If we cap insulin prices at something reasonable, like thirty dollars instead of two hundred, then people like your nephew wouldn't have to choose between rent and staying alive when they're between jobs.

**Voter:** You're absolutely right. If insulin had been thirty dollars, my sister could have helped him without it destroying her budget, and we wouldn't have had to watch him ration life-saving medication. That month was one of the scariest times for our family.

**Canvasser:** Exactly. And Frank, that's why I'm here today. There's legislation in Congress right now that would cap insulin prices, and it's coming up for a vote within the month. We're asking people to call their representatives to support it. After what your family went through, and knowing my brother faces that same fear every day - would you be willing to make that call?

**Voter:** You know what? After thinking about what we went through with my nephew, and knowing your brother lives with that constant worry... yes, I think I'd be willing to do that. Who would I need to contact exactly?

**Canvasser:** That would mean so much, Frank. Here, let me give you a card with your representative's number. When you call, you'll talk to one of the staffers. Just tell them your name and ZIP code so they know you're a constituent, and then you can share your story - tell them about your nephew and that you support the insulin price cap legislation. Your personal experience will be really powerful.

**Voter:** I can do that. And honestly, after talking this through with you, I feel like I should. No family should have to go through what we did.

**Canvasser:** Thank you so much, Frank. Your nephew is lucky to have an uncle who cares enough to take action. And who knows - your call might help prevent other families from experiencing what you all went through.
