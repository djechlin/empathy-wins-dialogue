# General instructions

- ignore any technical issues (fiddling with microphone, talking to someone else in the background, etc) as the frontend engineer is working to make these not happen.

## What the Canvasser Did Well

**Personal Storytelling**

- Effectively shared a personal story about his brother having diabetes, which created an emotional connection
- Made the issue tangible and relatable by connecting it to someone he cares about

**Listening and Responding**

- Acknowledged the voter's initial skepticism about government involvement respectfully
- Built on the voter's concerns rather than dismissing them ("I understand where you're coming from")
- Picked up on the voter's mention of his nephew and used it to strengthen the connection

**Bridging Personal to Political**

- Successfully connected the personal stories (his brother, voter's nephew) to the policy solution
- Helped the voter see how the price cap would have directly helped his family's situation

**Concrete Action Steps**

- Provided specific, actionable next steps (calling the representative)
- Had materials ready (card with contact information)
- Gave clear talking points for the phone call

## Areas for Improvement

**Technical Disruptions**

- Got distracted by timer and technical issues mid-conversation, breaking the emotional flow
- Lost focus on the voter when dealing with the role-playing logistics
- These interruptions undermined the authentic connection being built

**Missed Opportunities for Deeper Exploration**

- Could have explored the voter's initial skepticism about government involvement more thoroughly
- Didn't fully probe the voter's values around fairness and corporate responsibility
- The voter hinted at this being "not right" - could have explored those moral intuitions further

**Rushed Transition to Action**

- Moved to the ask relatively quickly without fully cementing the emotional connection
- Could have spent more time helping the voter process how this issue connects to his broader values

**Story Development**

- Could have shared more details about how his brother's situation affects the family emotionally
- Missed opportunity to explore the voter's nephew's story in greater depth

## Overall Assessment

The canvasser demonstrated solid deep canvassing fundamentals - using personal narrative, finding common ground, and connecting individual stories to policy solutions. The conversation successfully moved the voter from skepticism to commitment. However, the technical disruptions and somewhat rushed pacing prevented this from being a truly transformative deep canvassing conversation. With better focus and more time spent in the exploratory phase, this could have been even more impactful.

# Lucas - deepen

Looking at this canvassing dialogue through the lens of deep canvassing technique, here's my analysis:

## What the Canvasser Did Well

**Excellent Personal Connection Building**

- Used the voter's name consistently throughout the conversation, creating intimacy
- Shared his own vulnerable story about his brother's diabetes, demonstrating authentic reciprocity
- Moved seamlessly from transactional interaction to genuine human connection

**Masterful Narrative Elicitation**

- Asked open-ended questions that invited storytelling: "Can you tell me more about what that month was like?"
- Probed for emotional details and concrete experiences rather than staying in abstract policy discussion
- Allowed space for the voter to fully express his story without rushing to rebut

**Strong Emotional Resonance**

- Acknowledged and validated the voter's emotions: "That sounds absolutely heartbreaking"
- Connected the voter's family experience to his own brother's situation
- Helped the voter see the unnecessary nature of the fear his family experienced

**Effective Issue Reframing**

- Skillfully distinguished between new medication research costs and century-old insulin
- Used concrete comparisons (Mexico vs. US pricing) to illustrate the problem's scope
- Connected policy solution directly to the voter's personal story

## Areas for Improvement

**Rushed Transition to Action**

- Moved too quickly from story-sharing to the legislative ask
- Could have spent more time exploring the voter's evolving perspective on government intervention
- The jump from "your nephew's story hits home" to "there's legislation in Congress" felt somewhat abrupt

**Missed Deeper Exploration Opportunities**

- Could have asked more about how this experience changed the voter's broader views on healthcare policy
- Didn't fully explore the tension between the voter's initial skepticism about government involvement and his personal experience
- Could have invited reflection on what this story reveals about his values

**Limited Perspective-Taking Facilitation**

- While the voter clearly connected to the issue personally, the canvasser could have helped him think more broadly about others in similar situations
- Missed opportunity to help the voter generalize from his nephew's experience to systemic understanding

## Overall Assessment

This dialogue demonstrates strong deep canvassing fundamentals—the canvasser successfully moved the conversation from abstract policy debate to personal storytelling, created genuine emotional connection, and achieved the practical goal of securing commitment to action. The voter's transformation from skeptical ("government getting involved just makes things more expensive") to committed ("I feel like I should") shows effective attitude change through narrative engagement.

The main weakness is pacing—a slightly slower transition to the ask, with more time spent helping the voter process how his story connects to his broader worldview, would have created even deeper and more durable attitude change.
