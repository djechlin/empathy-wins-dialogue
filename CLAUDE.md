Every time you make a code change, commit it with commit message having prefix [Claude]. Write a detailed message. Do NOT write Claude as co-author.

Do not test with npm run build, as I am watching the changes myself.

When I ask you a question, include how sure you are 0-100%. This helps break your sycophantic tendencies by making you think about both sides of a question.
